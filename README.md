# VPA Challenge: stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
This Project was meant to research the stock market datasets over the years of 2017 & 2018.

## Results

**2017 Results**
In the 2017 results, based on the formatting I can see that the there were a lot more positive returns in the stock market of that year. Given that for most of the tickers the results are green.

**2018 Results**
In the 2018 Results, based on the formatting I can see that this was not a good year for returns as most of teh returns are red or in the negative percentile.

**Execution Times**
Although Both datasets have pretty opposite returns in the stock market the execution time for both of them are close. In the snippet that I got the 2018 results were executed 0.0039062 seconds faster than the 2017 results.However in both datasets the execution time for the original code was over 1 second whereas the refactored code was under 1 second.

## Summary
The advantages of refactoring code is that in the process it can improve the design or cleanliness of the code, it also can make the code easier to understand. It also helps to find bugs and find ways of executing the code or program faster. The disadvantages of refactoring code is that it is time consuming, and that there is a chance of making a mistake that will just take up more time trying to figure it out.

These apply to the refactoring of teh original VPA script because in refactoring the code I did run into a couple errors that I had not seen before in the original script that took some time to solve even if tehy were simple changes. However, after going through the motions of refactoring the code I have a better understanding of how it works. Also, by refactoring the code I was able to cut down teh execution time to under 1 second for both datasets.
